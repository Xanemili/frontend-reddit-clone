                       Hey guys, so I just moved into this apartment about a week ago and with Black Friday coming up I thought I would spend some money in decorating my boring walls.
                       My walls are white and soon to be painted gray, my length of my walls is 28ft/168in and the width of my room is 19ft/117in.
                       I was going to buy 3 wall scrolls and LED lights for my roof but I feel like there‚Äôs more I could do.
                       An idea I had was to space out the wall scrolls and add a wall shelf in the middle of them and put a couple of books on them and put a figure of the character in the book next to them but I‚Äôve had second thoughts about it because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll look that good. Ive also thought about putting the wall scrolls on one wall and putting a flag or a banner over the head of my bed (the bed is in the center of the 19ft/117in wall to give you a better idea of how it looks like).
                       Sorry this is so long and a little confusing but I just need some wall decor ideas in general. Any suggestions are appreciated :)""",
